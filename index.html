          <p>Pivotal Response Training (PRT) is an evidence-based practice designed to improve learning in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders in the areas of communication, social interaction, self-initiations, play skills, and academic skills in one-on-one settings. However, psychologists, teachers, and school administrators believe children with autism are best served by a collaborative community approach, so we have come together to develop a program for use during day-to-day classroom activities. This new method is known as Classroom Pivotal Response Training (CPRT) and it highlights changes that make the program more suited to group classroom environments.</p>

          <p>CPRT is a naturalistic, behavioral approach to teaching students with Autism that is soundly supported in the scientific literature. Managing the classroom and the highly varied needs of students with autism can be a challenge and teachers we have worked with have found CPRT to be fun and easy to implement with their students. Using CPRT is also not likely to require a dramatic change in the way teachers are interacting with their students; instead, it provides a way to label and enhance teaching methods to maximize student achievement, easily identify strengths and weaknesses, and train others to use the same approach. CPRT can work in your classroom because it was designed specifically with the benefits and challenges of the classroom in mind.</p>
                        
          <p>Our hope is that CPRT meets these criteria for you.</p>

                <h2> What is CPRT? </h2>
                <p> Classroom Pivotal Response Teaching (CPRT) is a naturalistic behavioral intervention that is soundly supported by the scientific literature and has been developed for use during day-to-day classroom activities. The intervention focuses on student motivation and involves presenting clear opportunities to respond, supporting student skill use, and providing appropriate consequences based on student behavior. CPRT can be used to teach variety of skills, including communication, play, peer social interaction, self-initiations, academic skills, and joint attention. CPRT has been adapted for classroom use from a program called Pivotal Response Training (PRT). PRT is based on a series of studies identifying important treatment components. CPRT has specific, evidence-based components, which are based on the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA).</p>
                
                <h2> Who can participate?</h2>
                <p> Classroom staff that work with participating teachers and teachers with at least two students who have an autism spectrum disorder and are 3-10 years old. If the lead teacher in your classroom is participating in this study, the classroom staff is also eligible to participate.</p>
                
                <p> You cannot have received any prior training in CPRT.</p>
                
                <p>About 100 classrooms (teachers, staff, students) in San Diego County will have the opportunity to participate.</p>
                
                <h2> What will happen?</h2>
                <p>Training will take place over the course of one school year. During the Training Year, you will attend 12 hours of group workshops (2 hours/week for 6 weeks). The workshops will be scheduled at times and locations that are convenient for you. You will also receive coaching in your classroom while working with your own students.</p>
                
                <p>However, all participating classrooms will not receive training in the same year. Some teachers will be trained during the 2012/2013 school year, but others will be trained during the 2013/2014 or 2014/2015 school year. </p>
                
                <h2> Who do I contact?</h2>
                <p>If you are interested in participating, please contact Renee Herman at (858) 966-7703 extension 7148.</p>

                <p> Aubyn C. Stahmer, Ph.D. is a Research Scientist at the Child and Adolescent Services Research Center (CASRC), an Associate Project Scientist in the Department of Psychology at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and the Research Director at Rady Childrenís Hospital Autism Discovery Institute. She has over 20 years of experience working with children with autism and using Pivotal Response Training. One of the major goals of her research has been to examine educational services for young children with autism in order to inform the translation of evidence-based practice into community settings. Dr. Stahmer has extensive experience training teachers in behavioral and developmental techniques and developing clinically relevant ongoing program fidelity of implementation procedures.</p>

                <p>Jessica Suhrheinrich, Ph.D. is a post-doctoral researcher at UCSD and CASRC. She is an experienced PRT trainer. Her primary area of research interest involves examining the use of PRT by classroom teachers and the best methods of training teachers to use PRT in the classroom. Before beginning graduate school, she was a classroom teacher herself and has an excellent understanding of the barriers to translation of evidence-based practice to community settings.</p>

                <p>Sarah Reed, Ph.D. is a post-doctoral researcher at UCSD and CASRC. Her graduate research focuses on the implementation of evidence-based treatments in community environments and how to optimally translate intervention research across service-delivery settings. Her primary research interest involves continuing to examine the effectiveness of PRT with groups of students, as this is the service reality for many settings. Clinically, Sarah has extensive experience implementing naturalistic, behavioral interventions with children with autism as well as providing training to parents, clinicians, and students in these methods.</p>

          <div class="tab-pane" id="faq">
                <h2> Why do I have to do all this stuff before and after the training?</h2>
                <p>The reason we can provide free comprehensive training is that we are funded to do a research study evaluating CPRT. To accurately measure how much participating teachers and students learn, we have to have assessments before and after everyone participates in training. We also need to have a “control group” or a group of teachers and students who are currently not going through the training. This allows us to measure how much change is related to receiving training in CPRT.</p>
                
                <h2>How much time does this really take?</h2>
                <p>The training itself will take 12 hours (6 workshops that are 2 hours each). You’ll be asked to review materials in the CPRT manual we provide and practice activities with your students during the regular school day. This may take about 1 hour each week during the training weeks.</p>
                
                <p>We will also ask you to complete a weekly checklist that will take about 5 minutes each week throughout the school year.</p>
                
                <p>You will also complete some paperwork about yourself and your target students during the Training Year and the Observation Year. This will take about 1 hour at the beginning and end of each year.</p>
                
                <h2>What are the Classroom Observations?</h2>
                <p>The Classroom Observations are our opportunity to see how you teach your students. You will get to choose two activities (about 15-30 minutes each) that we use for the Classroom Observation throughout the entire project. You will get to choose the dates and times for the observations. During the Training Year and the Observation Year, the Classroom Observations will happen once every other month (e.g., September, November, January, March, May). During the Follow-up years, we will only schedule one to two Classroom Observations.</p>
                
                <h2>How will this affect the other staff in my classroom?</h2>
                <p>The paraprofessionals/assistants in your classroom are invited to participate too. If they don’t want to participate, that’s   OK too. They can attend the group workshops or watch brief computer-based presentations that have been developed to help teachers train paraprofessional staff. Paraprofessionals will also receive individual coaching if they choose to participate. </p>
